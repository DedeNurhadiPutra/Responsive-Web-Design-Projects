                Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant
                syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point for
                creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating something
                amazing while we sweat the details.
            </p>
            <p>
                Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience while
                providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, an
                expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit
                and integration testing, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you are new to PHP or web frameworks or have years of
                experience, Laravel is a framework that can grow with you. We'll help
                you take your first steps as a web developer or give you a boost as
                you take your expertise to the next level. We can't wait to see what
                you build.

            <p>
                We want it to be as easy as possible to get started with Laravel.
                There are a variety of options for developing and running a Laravel
                project on your own computer. While you may wish to explore these
                options at a later time, Laravel provides Sail, a built-in solution
                for running your Laravel project using Docker.
            </p>
            <p>
                Docker is a tool for running applications and services in small,
                light-weight "containers" which do not interfere with your local
                computer's installed software or configuration. This means you don't
                have to worry about configuring or setting up complicated development
                tools such as web servers and databases on your personal computer. To
                get started, you only need to install Docker Desktop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting
                with Laravel's default Docker configuration. Sail provides a great
                starting point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL,
                and Redis without requiring prior Docker experience.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Installation_Via_Composer">
            <header>Installation Via Composer</header>
            <p>
                If your computer already has PHP and Composer installed, you may
                create a new Laravel project by using Composer directly. After the
                application has been created, you may start Laravel's local
                development server using the Artisan CLI's serve command:
            </p>
            <code>
                composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app<br />
                cd example-app<br />
                php artisan serve<br />
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Initial_Configuration">
            <header>Initial Configuration</header>
            <p>
                All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in
                the config directory. Each option is documented, so feel free to look
                through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Laravel needs almost no additional configuration out of the box. You
                are free to get started developing! However, you may wish to review
                the config/app.php file and its documentation. It contains several
                options such as timezone and locale that you may wish to change
                according to your application.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Next_Steps">
            <header>Next Steps</header>
            <p>
                Now that you have created your Laravel project, you may be wondering
                what to learn next. First, we strongly recommend becoming familiar
                with how Laravel works by reading the following documentation:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Request Lifecycle</li>
                <li>Configuration</li>
                <li>Directory Structure</li>
                <li>Service Container</li>
                <li>Facades</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                How you want to use Laravel will also dictate the next steps on your
                journey. There are a variety of ways to use Laravel, and we'll explore
                two primary use cases for the framework below.
